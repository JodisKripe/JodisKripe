- 👀 I like working on anything and everything related to CyberSecurity
- 🌱 I'm particularly interested in Network Penetration Testing and System Security(Win/Lin) and would love to dabble into hardware too.
- ☯ I love writing(and obviously learning to write) malware and watching it detonate. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Tool creation for Active Directory Recon, Mapping, AV Evasion etc.
